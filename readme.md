# My prediction for the technical approach of next 2 weeks' ChatGPT o4-mini

April 6, 2025

Based on observed limitations in current AI training, here's a thought on what might underpin the anticipated ChatGPT o4-mini.

Current AI training methodologies, such as reinforcement learning, heavily emphasize optimizing for the correctness of information within an "independent event" framework. The focus is primarily on reinforcing the right or wrong outcome for each specific instance.

However, highly efficient human learning goes beyond this. While correctness is crucial, humans also excel at applying logical reasoning based on information – reasoning that isn't strictly necessary just to determine correctness. This includes abstracting experiences from specific information and transferring that abstracted knowledge to other, potentially different, contexts.

Today's AI often struggles with this. An AI might master a mathematical concept but fail when the problem is presented slightly differently, even if the core mathematical idea remains identical. This suggests a weakness in generalizing and transferring learned experiences.

My prediction is that a significant advancement, perhaps seen in o4-mini, would involve breaking away from this "independent event" training limitation. A potential technical direction could be a training model that explicitly rewards the AI for extracting insights and experiences from past training events and applying them effectively to new, ongoing tasks.

If ChatGPT o4-mini incorporates such mechanisms—enhancing its ability to abstract and transfer experience—we should expect a noticeable improvement in its overall capability and learning efficiency.
